I'm happy to say that this time it didn't take me over a thousand days to write another one. However, in some aspects, it has been much longer as 2023 has felt like about half a decade. This year more than others has given me a feeling of reflection of my life and the future I am working towards. This is also where I got the title of this post from (<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">Memento Mori</a>) which in Latin means to '<em>remember that you will die</em>'. I've often thought about this phrase and although it is grim it gives me a sense of motivation that nothing else ever has. In a few weeks, I will be turning <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>38</strong></span>. As I reflect on the goals I have set out for myself, I come at it from the perspective of who I want to be remembered as, because as sad as it is, I too <em>will</em> die. That being said, thinking about my future gives me an excitement &amp; motivation for life that drives me to try and make the most of the time I have.</p>

My youngest is now 3 and is done with baby stuff like soothers &amp; diapers so she is much easier now and is going to preschool. The oldest is now in grade 2 and has become very independent. Fatherhood is becoming more challenging in a positive way in that I have great conversations with both my kids now that perhaps I wasn't doing as well in years prior. We've also got another beagle named Atom to go with our dog Sky which has been a handful for sure as comes with a puppy. I am hopeful that he will be a good dog like our girl dog because she had similar behaviour issues as a puppy which she has now grown out of. The house is full of barking, yelling and also laughter and joy sometimes.</p>
<p>With my career I am feeling happy where I am at Microsoft. In April of this year I ended up being moved to another team as the one I was on got reassigned, and it's been a great change where I am now working with a local Vancouver team on a front-end focused codebase which is what I currently desired. I feel like I am still on track for my goal of becoming a Senior Software Engineer which is my next level at Microsoft which I'd expected would take at least 2 years. I enjoy meeting my team once a week, and the rest of the week I still work from home. I've been able to contribute much more this year as my entire team works on the same codebase as me and there are many more opportunities to get involved.</p>

After 8 years we've finally got a new comfortable king bed and black out curtains which has really helped my sleep. I finally switched to the new <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_8_pro">Pixel 8 Pro</a> which is my first time ever having a "Pro" phone and is a bit of a luxury, but at the same time it was cheaper than my old S20 and comes with a free Pixel 2 watch (still waiting for it). I mention my phone and watch because I had somewhat given up on a smart watch and fancy phone for almost 5 years now, but I finally decided that it was a worthwhile life upgrade just to make things a little bit easier/modern.</p>

At the end of March I got <a href="https://winners.webbyawards.com/winners/websites-and-mobile-sites/general-websites-and-mobile-sites/personal-blogwebsite">nominated</a> for a Webby award for my website and I am trying again this year with the hope of winning in April 2024. I've continued adding to the project throughout the year which I discussed in my recent <a href="https://youtu.be/RRLq3T0Surs">Feature Review</a> video. It's still something that puts me in the flow and I hope for it to keep me motivated for a long time to come. I enjoy hearing all the feedback from people who think it's cool and are interested in how it works. The <a href="https://github.com/DustinBrett/daedalOS">project</a> has continued to gain popularity on GitHub and now has over 6,800 stars. I've begun to form a long term plan for this project in which I move away from frameworks/libraries and start doing everything on my own based on Web API's. It will be another learning opportunity and I am excited to make bigger goals for the future of the project.</p>
<p>My YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DustinBrett">channel</a> has nearly doubled for subscribers since the last time I posted, from under 2,000 to now being almost 3,500. I've also posted 29 more videos and got paid $200 by YouTube since becoming monetized. My focus for my videos is still on things I love and I really enjoy making them for myself more than anything. Upon reviewing these numbers, I am pleased with the progress and my goal is another 25-30 videos in 2024 assuming I continue to have stuff worth talking about. I also plan to write another blog post next year and to keep this tradition going into the foreseeable future.</p>
